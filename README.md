# Deckmaster

A Twitch overlay for MTG Arena. Install the extension at https://www.twitch.tv/ext/cplheah4pxjyuwe9mkno9kbmb11lyc

## Development How-To

1.  Use Windows 10 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu installed. You may be able to use other flavors of linux but only Ubuntu has been tested. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 for instructions on installing WSL and Ubuntu.

2.  Install VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/

3.  In your WSL Ubuntu shell, navigate to the folder containing Deckmaster and run `./init.sh`. This will set up a Vagrant container with all the dependencies you need, and open a shell inside the container for you to run further commands.
